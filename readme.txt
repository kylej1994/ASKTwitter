Here is the initial code.

This is the code for our Random Song Generator, created by Alec Snyder, Sam Baugh, and Kyle Jablon.

We  created a random song generator, where users would input a seed word, and using a pre-existing database of
billboard top 100 songs (scraped online), we would generate a song for the user using a Markov Chain, complete
with music, and "singing" by a robotic voice.

Our databse is a small sample database just called "file.txt", and 4 songs for the database. A lot of the code
for what would have been the website isn't entirely finished (largely due to time constraints)
, but the actual random generation of the song, and database is complete.
